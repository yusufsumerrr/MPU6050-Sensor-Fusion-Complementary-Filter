# MPU6050-Sensor-Fusion-Complementary-Filter
This project performs real-time **attitude estimation** using data from the **MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**. The process begins with the calculation of the fundamental Euler angles (`Roll` and `Pitch`) using the gravity components obtained from the accelerometer and the angular velocity data from the gyroscope. These raw angle estimates are then combined using a `Complementary Filter` algorithm, which optimizes the high-frequency noise of the accelerometer and the time-accumulated drift error of the gyroscope. As a result of sensor fusion, the stabilized orientation data are transmitted via serial communication and visualized in real time as a 3D representation using a Python/PyGame-based interface to evaluate the system’s dynamic performance.
